# Superdense-Coding-Protocol
This repository presents a detailed implementation of superdense coding, a quantum communication protocol that enables the transmission of two classical bits of information using a single qubit. This protocol leverages the principles of quantum entanglement to achieve this feat, surpassing the classical limit of one bit per qubit.
